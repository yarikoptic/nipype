This is the documentation for NIPY's interfaces and pipelines project,
*nipype*.  Nipype intends to create Python interfaces to other
neuroimaging packages and create an API for specifying a full analysis
pipeline in Python.  Currently, we have interfaces for SPM and FSL.
Please see our :ref:`documentation` page for details and tutorials
showing how to use nipype.  Our :ref:`install` page lists software
dependencies in addition to installation instructions.
