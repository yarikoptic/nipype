The numpytesting directory contains a copy of all the files from
numpy/testing for numpy version 1.3.  This provides all the test
integration with the nose test framework we need to run the nipype
tests.  By including these files, nipype can now run on systems that
only have numpy 1.1, like Debian Lenny.  This feature was added by
Yaroslav Halchenko.
