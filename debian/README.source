nipype for Debian
-----------------

Due to rapid development of Nipype and ease to maintain, packaging is based on
git-svned clone of upstream repository.  Please refer to XS-Vcs fields and
debcheckout to obtain complete snapshot of the git repository with
upstream (might be not fully up to date) + debian packaging.
